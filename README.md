### What I learned

This challenge was quite hard, was my first real Javascript challenge ever. I took a lots of time trying to find out how to make the rating buttons connect to the submit button to display the output popup showing the selected number. I had look several challenges to undestand the JS structure so I follow a video from this channel in youtube [TsbSankara - JavaScript - Interactive Rating Component](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQnUopEeZgw). Once I did the basic challenge I created a modal screen to request the user to select a button before submit, for the second step I had to ask a friend (@adrianoescarabote) for help and after some explanations I get it.
